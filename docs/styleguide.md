# Styleguide

## Naming
- Components: `PascalCase` for Vue components.
- Composables: `useXxx` for hooks.
- Stores: `xxxStore` when using Pinia.

## UI Consistency
- Prefer Tailwind utilities over custom CSS.
- Use consistent spacing scale (`2/4/6/8/12/16`).
- Keep card layouts with rounded corners and subtle borders.

## Copywriting
- Use short, action-oriented labels.
- Keep system messages neutral and professional.
- Avoid demo/placeholder wording in production copy.

## Error Messaging
- Explain the action that failed and the next step.
- Avoid leaking internal errors in UI.
